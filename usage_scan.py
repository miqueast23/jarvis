"""Per-session token usage, read off Claude Code's own transcripts.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`usage_store` holds what the CLI told us about the SUBSCRIPTION's limits —
the five-hour and seven-day windows. That is the whole picture of "how close
am I to being cut off", and none of the picture of "what did each
conversation actually cost". The second question is only answerable from the
transcripts, because that is the only place a per-message `usage` block is
written down.

WHAT IS ON DISK
---------------
Two config roots must be read (`~/.claude` and `~/.claude-orcha`; see
`session_watch.config_roots`). Under each:

    projects/<encoded cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl
        the conversation. Every `assistant` line carries
        `message.usage.{input,output,cache_read_input,cache_creation_input}_tokens`
        and `message.model`.

    projects/<encoded cwd>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl
        one file per subagent that conversation dispatched. Same `sessionId`,
        `isSidechain: true`, its own `agentId`. Measured 2026-09-03: 1,573 of
        these against 947 conversations — subagent work is the majority of
        the files on this machine and most of nobody's picture of usage.

THE TRAPS, ALL THREE MEASURED ON THIS MACHINE
---------------------------------------------
1. THE ROOTS ARE HARDLINKED. `~/.claude/projects/…/x.jsonl` and
   `~/.claude-orcha/projects/…/x.jsonl` were the same inode, link count 2.
   Unioning the roots without deduping by (st_dev, st_ino) doubles every
   token on the page. Dedupe is by inode, not by filename, because two roots
   may also legitimately hold two different conversations.

2. THE CORPUS IS HUGE. 548 MB in 2,544 files, the largest 95 MB. A cold
   full parse takes ~3 s. So a `Cache` remembers each file's inode, length
   and running totals, and a rescan reads only the appended bytes. A file
   that shrank, or whose inode changed under the same path, is read again
   from zero — resuming into a rewritten file would carry a total that no
   longer describes it.

3. SUMMED INPUT TOKENS ARE NOT THE CONTEXT. Every turn re-sends the
   conversation, so summing `input_tokens` over a long session reports a
   200 k window as several million. The context is the LAST turn's
   input + cache_read + cache_creation, and it is reported separately.

HONESTY
-------
Absence is preserved as absence. A machine with no transcripts reports
`measured: False` and an empty list — never a confident zero. A session whose
transcript holds no assistant turn has `context_tokens: None`, not 0.

And JARVIS's own machinery is not the user's work. His brain (identified by
its cwd, exactly as `session_watch` identifies it) and every run he spawned
(a run id IS its `--session-id`) are reported in their own bucket and never
added into the user's totals.

No I/O beyond reading these files; no server imports; never raises on a file
being written underneath it.
