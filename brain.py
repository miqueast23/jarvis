# computed per launch, from their file, and added to (never merged into)
# ALLOWED_TOOLS.
#
# It stays an ALLOWLIST. What is granted is exactly one `mcp__<server>` per
# server the user wrote down themselves; a server they did not declare is
# still refused, and so is every built-in a future CLI invents. Nothing here
# is ever expressed as "everything except".
#
# The grant names the SERVER, not its tools, and that is not laziness: JARVIS
# cannot know a server's tool names before it starts one, so enumerating them
# would mean either starting every server twice or guessing. Verified against
# `claude` 2.1.259: `--tools mcp__weather` admits `mcp__weather__forecast` and
# `mcp__weather__tide`.
#
# Also measured, and worth stating plainly because it decides how much this
# flag is actually load-bearing: that CLI does NOT filter MCP tools by
# `--tools` at all — with `--tools WebSearch` and a weather server in
# `--mcp-config`, both weather tools were still offered to the model. What
# really gates an MCP tool is whether its server is in `--mcp-config`
# (see server.py's `_write_mcp_config`) and, for JARVIS's own, the origin gate
# on `/internal/tool`. The grant is kept anyway: it costs nothing, it states
# the intent in the one place a reader will look, and if the CLI ever enforces
# `--tools` over MCP names again, a user's declared server keeps working
# instead of going silently dead.

# close in the first place: it is operator prose, in every generation, above
# and outside every block.
#
# It nevertheless carried three values somebody else chose, raw:
#
#   * the ACTIVE PROJECT NAMES. `server._active_project_names` reads
#     `s.project`, which is `Path(cwd).name` out of another process's
#     `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`. `session_watch._parse_entry` never
#     stats that cwd, so the directory need not exist — a roster entry can
#     claim any name at all, of any length, any number of times.
#   * the USER NAME, out of `USER_NAME` in the `.env` the settings endpoints
#     write.
#   * the TAINT LABEL, which for one of the user's own MCP servers is
#     `name.split("__")[1]` — a server name, not a word this repository chose.
#
# So the same two walls, spelled here rather than imported: `brain.py` cannot
# import `server.py`, because `server.py` imports `brain.py`. Both use
# `fullmatch` and carry no `$`, for the reason `server._plain_name` records —
# Python's `$` matches before a trailing newline, and one newline in a header
# is one whole line of forged operator prose.
#
# `plain_name` is for IDENTIFIERS (a directory name): all or nothing, no
# space. `plain_phrase` is for the two values that are a short phrase by
# nature — a person's name has spaces and may have an apostrophe or a hyphen,
# and an MCP server's name is a word or two. Neither admits a quote, an angle

        (`mark_untrusted_content`) rather than relying on that. None between
        turns: there is nothing to taint.

        another session's transcript, a run's error output and the words in a
        window on the user's screen are all written by somebody who is not
        JARVIS, and every one of them lands in a brain holding `spawn_run`,
        `run_command` and the memory writers. `server.TAINTING_TOOLS` is the
        set, and it is held exhaustive by a test.

        The label is said out loud in the refusal, so the user hears which
        thing JARVIS declined to act on rather than a generic no.
