"""JARVIS's tools, exposed to the brain as a stdio MCP server.

Deliberately thin: it holds no state and knows nothing about sessions. Every
call is forwarded to the running JARVIS server over loopback HTTP, which keeps
the state, enforces the origin gate, and caps the result. Hand-rolled JSON-RPC
over stdin/stdout — no new dependency, as the project requires.

The brain's environment is scrubbed of CLAUDE_CODE_* and ANTHROPIC_*, so the
endpoint URL and token path arrive through the `env` block of mcp.json.

# How long this child waits for the server's answer to one tool call.
#
# EVERY server-side tool handler must finish well inside this. uvicorn does
# NOT cancel a handler when its client gives up: if we time out here, the
# handler carries on and completes anyway, while the brain is told the server
# is unreachable — so JARVIS announces a failure and the action happens
# regardless. That exact lie was shipped once, by steer_session doing its
# read-back (a real TTS playback plus a cancel window, tens of seconds) inside
# the call.
#
# The rule that came out of it: long-running, user-facing work does not belong
# in a tool handler. Validate synchronously, stage the work, return at once,
# and let the server perform it AFTER the turn ends (see server.py's
# _perform_staged_steers). 20s is ample for handlers that obey that rule, and
# raising it would only buy patience for handlers that do not.

# The brain is `claude -p` with `--tools` set to an ALLOWLIST that names only
# these MCP tools, so it has no Read tool: handing it the PATH of a PNG would
# hand it a string it can do nothing whatever with. The one route an image has
# into that process is an MCP `image` content block on a tool result, which
# the CLI turns into a real image in the model's context.
#
# Verified end to end before this was built, not assumed: a throwaway stdio
# MCP server returning `{"type": "image", ...}` for a 1280x800 PNG reading
# "PURPLE WALRUS 7421", driven by
#   claude -p --strict-mcp-config --mcp-config … --tools mcp__t__see
#   "call the see tool and tell me the exact words in the image"
# answered "The image shows the exact words: PURPLE WALRUS 7421". So the
# mechanism works, and a path would not have.
#
# The image rides in its own key, NOT in `text`: the server caps every tool
# result's text at 1,500 characters, and base64 of even a small PNG is tens
# of thousands. Only `text` goes through that cap.
