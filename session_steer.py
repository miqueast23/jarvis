"""Post a message into a running Claude Code session.

The wire format is one JSON line on the session's inbox Unix socket. It carries
PEER authority, not the user's: the session receives it as a new turn (or
queues it between tool calls if busy), but it cannot dismiss a permission
prompt or a modal dialog. On this machine those are the two `waitingFor`
reasons that actually occur, so the caller must check before promising a fix.
