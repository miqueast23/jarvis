"""
JARVIS Notifier -- macOS notification fallback.

When JARVIS needs the user's attention but no browser tab is connected to
speak through, this posts a native macOS notification instead. See
actions.py for the project's usual pattern of driving `osascript`; this
module differs from it deliberately (see below) because the text here is
attacker-influenced.

Notification titles/messages surface a Claude Code session's title or its
last message -- text that originates in someone else's transcript, not
text JARVIS wrote itself. actions.py's `applescript_escape()` handles this
by escaping quotes/backslashes before interpolating into the script
*source*. That is fine for its callers, but here we take a stronger
approach: the script never contains the untrusted text at all. It is
written once as a fixed `on run argv` handler and read from stdin, and the
title/message/subtitle are passed as trailing argv strings, which
osascript hands to the script as plain data -- never parsed as AppleScript
source. There is no escaping step to get wrong because there is nothing to
escape: a value containing `" & do shell script "..." & "` is just a
string with those characters in it.
