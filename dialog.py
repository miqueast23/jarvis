"""Press one key in the terminal a Claude Code session is running in.

This is the most dangerous module in the project: it sends a synthetic
keystroke to a window on the user's machine. Aimed wrong, it types into
whatever the user is actually working in. Every decision here exists to make
that impossible, so read the three of them before changing anything.

**1. The target is found by tty, never by focus.** A session's pid maps to a
tty (`ps -o tty=`), and Terminal.app publishes the tty of every tab over
AppleScript. That gives an exact pid -> tty -> tab identity with no guessing.
If no Terminal tab owns that tty we return `not_found` and press NOTHING.
There is deliberately no "send it to the front window" fallback: on this
developer's machine the sessions live in Orcha.app, an Electron host whose
tabs AppleScript cannot address, and its ttys do not intersect Terminal's at
all — so a focus fallback would type into an unrelated window every single
time. `not_found` is the common case, and it is the correct one.

**2. The vocabulary is closed.** Return, Escape and a single digit 1-9. That
is the whole set, and it is a safety boundary rather than a convenience:
anything else — free text, an empty string, a multi-character string, a shell
fragment — is refused before any AppleScript is composed, let alone run. This
module never types text.

**3. Nothing here raises.** Every path returns an outcome string, so the
caller can always say something useful and always has something to audit.

Terminal.app only. iTerm2 exposes `tty` per session in much the same shape and
would slot in at `find_terminal_tab`, but it is not installed here, so it is
not claimed and not built. TIOCSTI — the host-independent way to do this — is
refused by macOS 26.2 with PermissionError even on a pty the process owns;
do not go looking for it again.
