"""Real builds: the spec that survives, the brief that drives, the plan that reports.

A `spawn_run` is one sentence handed to one unattended turn. That is the right
shape for "fix the typo in the footer" and the wrong shape for a project. The
user put it plainly: *"these like unattended runs where you can only give it
one thing and it just spits out a result isn't really what we want for complex
projects"* — real work is **detailed planning, a written spec, revision of that
spec, and then phased execution**, and the review cycles are where the quality
comes from.

Three things live here, and nothing else. No server imports, no asyncio, no
`claude` subprocess: `server.py` calls all of it, the filesystem parts through
`asyncio.to_thread`.

1. **The spec, written into the project.** `docs/superpowers/specs/` is where
   a project's designs live, and the spec is the only artifact that
   survives the thing that kills long builds — a compaction, a session
   replacement, JARVIS's own context rotation. What the user agreed by voice
   goes on disk *before* anything is spawned.

2. **The brief.** The whole process, handed over in one prompt: read the
   settled spec, write a phased plan, *review and revise that plan against the
   spec*, then execute it task by task under test-driven development, ticking
   the plan's checkboxes as it goes. `superpowers:brainstorming` has a hard
   human-approval gate — an earlier run obeyed it, asked one question, exited
   zero and built nothing — so the brief names that gate and shuts it, while
   sending the session to every skill AFTER it.

3. **Progress, read off the plan file.** A plan is machine-readable
   (`## Task N: title`, `- [ ]` / `- [x]`), so "how far has it got" has a real
   answer instead of a guess from the run's age.

Plus one guard: `command_problem`, which bounds what `run_command` is allowed
to put into a Terminal window. That text came out of a microphone and through
an LLM, so it is treated as such.

# --- The brief -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything a session needs to run a real project alone. Read it as a whole:
# each paragraph is load-bearing and was put there by something that went
# wrong without it.
#
#   * The operating condition comes FIRST, and states that no answer can
#     arrive — not that the session should "be autonomous". A vague
#     instruction was never going to beat `superpowers:brainstorming`'s
#     explicit "do NOT write any code until the user has approved a design".
#   * The approval gate is named and shut, and the reason is given: the design
#     is already approved, in a file, by a human, out loud.
#   * Planning, self-review, execution, TDD and verification are numbered
#     steps, not adjectives. "Review and revise your own plan" is step 2 of 6
#     and comes before any code, because that is the user's whole thesis:
#     *"the more models get feedback and review and revise their own
#     specs/planning, the better the result is."*
#   * Ticking the checkboxes is an instruction, because it is the only channel
#     through which `build_status` can say anything true.
#   * "Decide it and write the decision down" closes the last exit: a
#     long-running session WILL meet a question the spec does not answer, and
#     the failure mode is stopping to ask one nobody will read.
#   * The product bar is named explicitly, because the last project this drove
#     failed on exactly this: a pop-up asking the user to type in scan paths,
#     with no way out of it, and a README the user asked to have replaced with
#     "a simple command". Zero-config first launch, no undismissable modal, a
#     one-command README, and a UI that is not an afterthought are stated as
#     requirements the session verifies before it reports done, not left as
#     things a careful builder would probably do anyway.

BUILD_BRIEF_TEMPLATE = """\
[Long build — no human present] You are building a real project from a settled \
design, start to finish, in one long session. Nobody is watching this and \
nobody can answer a question: no reply can ever reach you, so ending your turn \
to ask something means the work simply never happens. There is no time limit. \
Take as long as the work honestly needs.

THE DESIGN IS SETTLED AND APPROVED. The user agreed it out loud and it is \
written down in this project at:

    {spec_path}

Read that file before anything else. Do NOT brainstorm, do NOT re-open the \
design, do NOT present a plan, a design or a set of options for approval, and \
do NOT invoke any skill that requires a human to approve something before you \
implement — superpowers:brainstorming in particular carries a hard approval \
gate, and that approval has already been given, in the file above. Treat the \
spec as the requirement it is: build what it says, and where it is silent, see \
step 6.

Then run the whole process yourself, in this order.

1. PLAN. Use superpowers:writing-plans to write a phased implementation plan \
into {plan_dir}/ before you touch any code. Give every task a `## Task N: \
<title>` heading and break it into `- [ ]` checkbox steps, each one small \
enough to finish and verify on its own.

2. REVIEW AND REVISE YOUR OWN PLAN, before you execute a line of it. Read the \
plan back against the spec and hunt for what is wrong with it: requirements in \
the spec that no task covers, tasks that contradict each other or the spec, \
steps left vague or holding a placeholder, ordering that would have you build \
on something that does not exist yet, and anything a reader could not execute \
without asking a question. Fix all of it in the plan file. Do this at least \
once and again whenever the plan stops matching reality — the revision is \
where the quality comes from, not the first draft.

3. EXECUTE with superpowers:subagent-driven-development, one task at a time: a \
fresh implementer subagent for each task, then a reviewer subagent over its \
work before you move on. Use superpowers:executing-plans instead only if the \
tasks are so entangled that handing one to a fresh subagent would cost more \
context than it saves. Say in one line which you chose and why, then start.

4. TEST-DRIVE EVERYTHING. Use superpowers:test-driven-development for every \
task — the failing test first, then the code that passes it. Before you call \
any task or the build done, use superpowers:verification-before-completion: \
run the tests, read the actual output, and never report work as finished on \
the strength of having written it. If something breaks, use \
superpowers:systematic-debugging rather than guessing at a fix.

5. TICK THE CHECKBOXES AS YOU GO. The moment a step is done and verified, edit \
the plan file and change its `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. That file is the only way the \
user can see how far you have got, so keep it current and keep it honest: \
never tick a box for work that is not finished and not verified.

6. NOBODY CAN ANSWER A QUESTION. Where the spec leaves a choice open, decide it \
yourself on the merits, write the decision and your reason into the plan file \
under the task it belongs to, and carry on. A question at the end of your turn \
builds nothing.

7. THE BAR THIS SHIP HAS TO CLEAR. The last project like this one failed on \
first launch: it opened with a pop-up demanding the user type in scan paths, \
with no way to dismiss it, and a README so complex the user asked whether \
there was "a simple command" instead. Do not repeat that. It must work on \
first launch with zero configuration — where you need to know something \
about the machine, find it out yourself; never open with a form or a prompt \
asking the user to type it in. No modal or dialog the user cannot dismiss or \
get past. The README's happy path is one command, not a checklist. The UI is \
not an afterthought bolted on last — it is part of what you are building and \
is held to the same bar as the logic underneath it. Before you report the \
build done, actually run what you built exactly as a first-time user would, \
starting from nothing configured, and confirm every one of those holds.

Commit as you go, one commit per completed task, and never push. When the last \
task is ticked and the tests pass, stop and say what you built.\
