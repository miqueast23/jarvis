"""JARVIS's eyes on the Mac itself: the window list, and one deliberate picture.

Two capabilities, priced very differently, exactly as `read_page` and
`look_at_page` are for the web:

1. `list_windows()` — which app is in front and what its windows are called.
   One AppleScript, a few hundred bytes, no pixels. "What am I looking at" is
   usually answerable from this alone.
2. `capture_screen()` — a PNG of the main display, shrunk, which the brain
   SEES. It reaches a `claude -p` process as an MCP `image` content block:
   the brain runs with `--tools` set to an allowlist of JARVIS's own tools and
   has no Read tool, so a path to a file would be a string it could do nothing
   with. `server.ToolImage` and `jarvis_mcp._image_block` are that route; this
   module is only a new source of pixels for it.

A version of this shipped in the first release and was deleted for being dead
code that routed through the Anthropic vision API. Two things are lifted from
it: the `screencapture -x` invocation and the System Events window script.
The API call is not — the brain runs on the user's subscription, on this
machine, and nothing here leaves it.

**This is a camera pointed at the user's life.** A screenshot can hold a
password, a private message, a client's data. So:

- Nothing here runs on a timer, speculatively, or as ambient context. The
  original's `format_windows_for_context()` fed screen state into every turn;
  that pattern does not come back. The tools are gated to a user-origin turn
  in `server.ACTING_TOOLS`, and this module is called from nowhere else.
- The capture lives in a `mkdtemp` directory for as long as it takes to shrink
  it and read the bytes — milliseconds — and the directory is removed in a
  `finally`, on every path out, success or failure.
- One display per call: the main one by default, or the display asked for.
  `screencapture` with neither `-m` nor `-D` writes one file PER display, so
  the flag is what makes the single file we read back a known screen rather
  than whichever one it happened to write first.

No new dependencies: `screencapture`, `sips` and `osascript`, each spawned
with an argument list (never a shell string) and each time-boxed. The one
permission probe is `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess` through `ctypes`, which
is the standard library.
