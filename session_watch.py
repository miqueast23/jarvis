"""Watch every Claude Code session on this machine.

Three levels, and the distinction matters: a *process* is one `claude`; a
*conversation* is one `sessionId` and one transcript; a *project* is one cwd.
Measured on 2026-09-03, 17 live processes were 14 conversations in 10
projects — three processes shared one hammer conversation. Counting processes
is what made JARVIS miscount sessions out loud, so speech uses conversations.

Pure filesystem reading: no asyncio, no server imports, no LLM. Every parse is
