"""Spawns Claude Code runs and records everything they do.

Invariant: every state transition is written to the store *before* it is
published to subscribers. The WebSocket is a cache-invalidation hint, never
a source of truth.

Second invariant: a run ALWAYS reaches a terminal state. Every exit path out
of `_drive` — success, non-zero exit, timeout, spawn failure, cancellation,
or an unexpected exception anywhere in the pipeline — writes a terminal
status. A run stuck in `running` or `queued` is the failure this module
exists to eliminate.

# its concurrency permit within half a minute instead of holding it for the
# life of the server.

# How long the child may say NOTHING while still holding stdout open.

# The EOF grace above is the wrong bound for almost every way a run goes
# quiet, because almost none of them produce EOF. Measured at the asyncio
# level, one child shape per row:
#
#   os.close(1)                      -> EOF        the grace above fires
#   sys.stdout.close()               -> no EOF     nothing fires
#   stops writing, fd 1 still open   -> no EOF     nothing fires
#   exits, grandchild holds fd 1     -> no EOF     nothing fires
#   SIGSTOPs itself                  -> no EOF     nothing fires
#
# `sys.stdout.close()` is the surprising one and it is worth spelling out:
# CPython builds the raw FileIO behind `sys.stdout` with `closefd=False`
# (pylifecycle's create_stdio), so that closing the Python object cannot
# take fd 1 away from the C runtime. Closing it therefore tears down the
# buffered wrapper and leaves the pipe's write end wide open. It is not the
# `os.close(1)` case at all — it is the "stopped talking" case, and so are
# the other three. EOF never arrives, `_consume` never returns, and `_drive`
# parks in `wait_for(reader, timeout=timeout_sec)` with only the six-hour
# wall clock left. The run stays `running` and holds one of three permits.
#
# Thirty minutes, and it is chosen against the longest silence a *working*
# run can legitimately produce, not against how long a wedged one is
# tolerable. The CLI emits a stream-json event per turn and per tool result,
# so the gaps are: one Bash tool call, which the CLI allows up to ten
# minutes; one thinking turn; and the CLI's own retry backoff on a 429 or a
# 529. Ten minutes is the biggest of those by a wide margin, so thirty gives
# roughly threefold headroom over the worst legitimate case — while still
# being a twelfth of the wall-clock bound, so a run that keeps talking is
# never cut short by it and a wedged one gives its permit back in half an
# hour rather than six.
#
# Override with JARVIS_RUN_IDLE_SEC. As with the wall clock there is
# deliberately no way to ask for "no bound".
_IDLE_OUTPUT_SEC = 30 * 60

# How often the read loop wakes up to ask "has anything happened".

# than any real `start_build` (which is explicitly meant to run for hours and
